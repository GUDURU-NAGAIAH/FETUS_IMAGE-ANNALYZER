# FETUS_IMAGE-ANNALYZER
🧠 Fetus Detection Using MATLAB (MLX)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an automated fetus detection system using MATLAB Live Script (.mlx), focusing on medical image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist in the analysis of prenatal images by detecting and highlighting fetal regions accurately, reducing manual effort and improving diagnostic efficiency.

The system processes input medical images through multiple stages including preprocessing, feature extraction, segmentation, and classification to identify fetal presence and structure.

⚙️ Methodology

The workflow of the project includes:

Image Acquisition

Input ultrasound or medical images are loaded into MATLAB for analysis.

Preprocessing

Noise reduction and image enhancement techniques are applied.

Images are converted to grayscale and resized for consistency.

Segmentation

Thresholding and morphological operations are used to isolate regions of interest.

Edge detection helps in identifying fetal boundaries.

Feature Extraction

Relevant features such as shape, intensity, and texture are extracted to distinguish fetal regions.

Detection & Visualization

The processed output highlights detected fetal areas.

Results are visualized at each stage using MATLAB plots for clear interpretation.
